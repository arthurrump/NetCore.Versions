# NetCore.Versions

This repo contains a data model for working with the `releases.json` files in the [dotnet/core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) repo. The goal is to provide a NuGet package to easily work with this data in your programs, but the first priority is with getting the models stable.

This project is a former part of [versionsof.net](https://versionsof.net) ([GitHub](https://github.com/arthurrump/versionsof.net))
