# NetCore.Versions

This repo contains a data model for working with the `releases.json` files in the [dotnet/core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) repo. 

The `NetCore.Versions.Checks` project is a GitHub app that runs checks on pull requests to those files to make sure that they are parseable and that the data is consistent with itself.

This project is a former part of [versionsof.net](https://versionsof.net) ([GitHub](https://github.com/arthurrump/versionsof.net))
